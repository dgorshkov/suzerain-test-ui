# Work summary

* This is the Unity source code for the [Torpor programmer/QA assignment](./assignment.pdf)
* I've timeboxed for this work 2 weekend days.
* The planned scope was not completed fully and not to a high standard (see the TODO section below).
* The biggest missing piece is the JSON data backend - I unfortunately couldn't implement it in a reasonable amount of time due to lack of previous experience. But I made it work using scriptable objects.
* At the same time, these results can be used to evaluate my level of skill (I'm aiming for a junior programmer skillset).
* The testcases for the full functionality are linked below. I have a lot more experience with QA compared to programming, so the cases are quite thorough.
